# Gensim
Gensim is a most famous NLP library for topic modeling/document classification, keyword extraction, word embeddings and many more.


In this model, I have created a summarizer using Gensim library. This module will allow you to extract a summary of a given text corpus.

But what is Summary?
a summary is a brief overview of an entire discussion or argument. 
You might summarize a whole research paper or conversation in a single paragraph, 
for example, or with a series of bullet points, using your own words and style.
